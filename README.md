# Spark

Spark is a web application built with Next.js, React, and MySQL that allows users to chat and talk with people in real-time. Similar to Discord, Spark lets users add friends, block users, create DMs, or servers. Users can also make voice and video calls with one another (well, not yet). Spark is an excellent solution for individuals or groups who want to communicate effectively and efficiently (at least once it'll be finished).
